# README

Hello there!  This is a quick POC exercise to build a book library management system in Rails 6.  The Ruby version used was v2.6.3.  

To get started with the app, clone the repository and run the command:
`rake db:create db:migrate db:seed`

Then run the server locall with the command `rails s`

After that you should be off to the races!
